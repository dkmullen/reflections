When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Perhaps when you need to make a fix while you are away from your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can review changes and additions online to see if they really benefit the project.
