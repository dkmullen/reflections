When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Perhaps when you need to make a fix while you are away from your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can review changes and additions online to see if they really benefit the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is basically a clone that happens on GitHub. Contains a link back to the original and allows the user to make his own changes. Useful in building on someone else's work while acknowledging them as the author.
A clone is a copy of a repository, made either from GitHub to a local machine or from one local rep to a new one. Useful for starting a brand new version of something of my own.
A branch is a new direction off a project that remains part of the repository.
