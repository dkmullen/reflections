What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up a new repository in the current directory. This sets the stage
for creating a version-controlled set of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it contains files that the user judges to be ready to commit.
It differs from the repository in that it is only a small set of files that have been updated.
It's value is that it allows the user to select a subset of the total files for commitment.
