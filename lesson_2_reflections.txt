What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up a new repository in the current directory. This sets the stage
for creating a version-controlled set of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it contains files that the user judges to be ready to commit.
It differs from the repository in that it is only a small set of files that have been updated.
It's value is that it allows the user to select a subset of the total files for commitment.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I don't think I understand this one. I'll say that you can use it to pile up files until you are sure your logical change is complete.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be useful when you want to take a program in a different direction - i.e., create a light version,
a different language, etc. Putting the program in two branches allows concurrent development.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They illustrate the dependencies of later commits on earlier ones and show where the code branches off.
